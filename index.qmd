## Introduction

I try to classify microplastics found in rivers sea to determine their source.

## The data

- There are **a lot** of fragments, then films
- Pellets are **always** less than 1e+08 (squared micrometers?)
- Turf and fillaments are **not round**
- Turf is mostly **opaque** (@fig-count)
- Pellets are mostly **translucent**
